# DataAnalysis-Project-using-python

In this data analysis is done using python. In this project , i have imported the numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib for a google apps review

In this project i have showed on how to deal with the outliers and how to do some data cleaning and transforming some of the null data by using median and mode.
I am going to plot some graphs to visually represent some data based on the reviews and ratings.
You can find the dataset in a seperate link
